## Introduction

Welcome to use MuLingCloud. We aim to let everything easier.

MLCBase is an open source Python library for multiple uses. It is the base module of all MuLingCloud modules and applications.

Supported platforms:

- ðŸ˜„ Windows (Python 3.6+)
- ðŸ˜„ Linux (Python 3.7+)
- MacOS (untested, maybe. I don't have a MacOS machineðŸ˜«. Anyone can help me?)

<summary>Features</summary>

- **Version**

    We define a `Version` class to manage the version of all MuLingCloud modules or applications. The instantiated versions can easily compare their order by using comparision operators, i.e. `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`.

- **Config Dictionary**

    We define a `ConfigDict` for more convenience usage. It is a type of dictionary inherited from `dict`. It has all the features of `dict` while including other more convenient features.

- **Logger**

    We build a `Logger` for more convenience logging management. Actually, this is a slightly improvement based on [loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru). Refer to [pylog](https://github.com/wmchen/pylog) for more information.

- **Runtime Analysis**

    We offer a simple way to evaluate functions in the Python project. All you need is to wrap the target function by a decorator.

- **File Operations**

    We offer various features to make file operations easier.

- **Encryption and Decryption**

    We offer various methods to encrypt and decrypt or verify text, files and passwords including RSA, AES and Hash.

- **Database**

    We offer a simple way to operate the database including creating a data table, inserting data, deleting data, searching data, and updating data. Currently only supports MySQL backend, but other backends will be supported in the future.

- **Remote Connection**

    We support SSH and SFTP for remote connection.

- **Email**

    We offer a simple API to send email. Currently only supports SMTP (with SSL) server.

- **HashiCorp Vault**

    We offer a simple API to get secrets from [HashiCorp/Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault). Currently only supports the secret engine of `kv2`, but other type of secret engines will be supported in the future.
